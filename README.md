- 👋 Hi, I’m @Gamme40

Welcome to my personal GitHub. Everything here is open-source as I believe strongly that information should not have prices.
Well information that won't cause our society to deviate from idealism.

- 👀 I’m interested in creating autonomous software.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to become a Computer Engineer.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that will improve my current capabilities.
- 📫 You are welcome to email me.
